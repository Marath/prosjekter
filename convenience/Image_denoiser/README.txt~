Unfinished image Denoiser since i lost my old hard drive. The point of this program is to run an 
algorithm in C, which makes noisy pictures clearer by rearranging the pixels. Program is a bit
messy, since this was the beta version, written in a week.

NOTES:

Requires OpenMPI to run. 
Makefile need a LIBPATH left that open on purpose
Do not have the pics yet, but will add them as soon as i find them

In progress:
- accept directories as well as multiple files (maybe just dirs, its easier)
- make the program run in paralell
- allow the program to run without MPI
